# library-management-system
This project will implement a basic backend API using Python and FastAPI.
Environment management is handled using Astral uv: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/
FastAPI was chosen for being the fastest Python API library, as well as the industry preference standard for new development. 
Astral uv was chosen as a package manager due to it's speed and comparative ease of use to other Python package managers.
