# library-management-system
This project will implement a basic backend API using Python and FastAPI.
Environment management is handled using Astral uv: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/
FastAPI was chosen for being the fastest Python API library, as well as the industry preference standard for new development. 
Astral uv was chosen as a package manager due to it's speed and comparative ease of use to other Python package managers.

How to run this project:
1. Run "uv install -r requirements.txt" (alternatively, "pip install -r requirements.txt")
2. Run "fastapi dev main.py"
3. Documentation for the available API endpoints can be found here(assuming you are using standard IP settings): http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs#/
